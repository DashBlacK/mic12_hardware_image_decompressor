Readme for COE3DQ5 Project Software Model 2018
Written by Jason Thong and Nicola Nicolici

IMPORTANT: The software model provides an exact specification of what computation is
done in the project, it says nothing about what hardware resources will perform the
computation and what clock cycle the computations and/or reads/writes from/to memory
will occur. Also, computation may be re-organized. We may choose to compute x*(y+z)
in software whereas in hardware it may be easier to do it as x*z+x*y, for example.

This directory contains the following C source files:

bmp_to_ppm.c
compare_ppm.c
decode_m1.c
decode_m2.c
decode_m3.c
encode_all.c

Each of these files compile independently. The codes are written in ANSI C and have
been tested with gcc in Mac OS 10.6 and Borland in Windows XP. They SHOULD compile
and run on other platforms.

To compile with gcc: gcc source_name.c -lm -o executable_name
To compile with Borland: bcc32 source_name.c

When running the software from the terminal (or command prompt in Windows), the
names of the input/output files as well as other parameters can be provided as command
line arguments. For example,

bmp_to_ppm picture.bmp picture.ppm

(in Mac OS and Linux, add a ./ before the executable)

specifies that the input file is picture.bmp and the output file is picture.ppm.
Please refer to the source code to see which command line argument is used for what.
If command line arguments are not provided, you will be prompted during run-time to
supply the necessary file names/parameters through the standard input.

Some other software you may find handy:

To view .ppm files, you can use FineView.exe under Windows. Alternatively, XnView
(google it) is a freeware viewer for Windows/Mac/Linux. MATLAB can also be used.

The data flow of the project is as follows:

bmp_to_ppm:
This converts a .bmp file (Windows bitmap) to a .ppm file. The data in a .ppm file
is organized as R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B2, etc. and the pixel order goes across first,
then down (like lab 5 experiment 2).

encode_all:
This encodes the .ppm file to a .mic12 file (McMaster Image Compression, revision 10).
The details of encoding are provided in the project document. As a summary, first we
do color space conversion, then downsampling of U and V, then IDCT on 8x8 blocks, and
finally lossless decoding and quantization. You will not need to implement any of
this in hardware.

decode_m3:
This is a reference for milestone 3 in hardware. The .mic12 file is lossless decoded
and dequantization is applied, the result is a .sram_d2 file. This file serves as
the input for milestone 2 (this file is organized exactly like the SRAM, so in the
testbench it can be used to initialize the SRAM for milestone 2). Also, this file
can be used to verify milestone 3 is working properly in hardware (testbench).

decode_m2:
This is a reference for milestone 2 in hardware. The .sram_d2 file contains pre-IDCT
data. We compute the IDCT on this data and the result is written to a .sram_d1 file.
Again, this is organized like the SRAM in hardware, which makes it easy to initialize
and compare the final data in the SRAM in a testbench.

decode_m1:
This is a reference for milestone 1 in hardware. The .sram_d1 file contains YUV data,
but the U and V are still downsampled versions. Horizontal interpolation is done to
upsample the odd columns of U and V (from the even columns, each row is processed
independently). Finally, for each pixel independently, the YUV data is converted to
RGB and the data is written back to the SRAM.

compare_ppm:
This is NOT part of the data flow in the project. Note that due to downsampling and
quantization, the compression is LOSSY, which means the decoded .ppm and original
.ppm will probably not be exactly the same. This program compare_ppm computes the
PSNR between 2 ppm images (see project document for details).

process_all.sh:

This script compiles all the sources and it runs all the executables for all the .bmp files
in the working directory.

clean_all.sh:

This script cleans all the intermediate files and it leaves only the sources and the .bmp 
files in the working directory.

Hardware design:

UART is used to initialize the SRAM, see lab 5 experiment 4. After data is processed
and written back to the SRAM, a state machine like the one in lab 5 experiment 4 is
used to read from the SRAM and display on the VGA monitor. This backbone and the
corresponding testbench is given to you already.

In the project, the first hardware you will design is that which processes data
closest to the final RGB data. Milestone 1 is the last stage of decoding. As you
progress through the project, you will process data further back from the final data.
Milestone 3 is the first stage of decoding.
